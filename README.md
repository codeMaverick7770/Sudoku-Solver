# Sudoku Solver

## Overview

The Sudoku Solver is a project designed to solve Sudoku puzzles using advanced data structures and algorithms. This implementation uses a combination of recursion, backtracking, and constraint propagation to efficiently solve standard 9x9 Sudoku puzzles.

## Features

- **Backtracking Algorithm**: Uses a recursive approach to try different numbers in each cell, undoing changes when conflicts arise.
- **Constraint Propagation**: Ensures that each number is placed in compliance with Sudoku rules, reducing unnecessary calculations.
- **User-Friendly Interface**: Provides an easy-to-use interface for inputting Sudoku puzzles and displaying solutions.

## How It Works

1. **Input**: Accepts a partially completed Sudoku grid as input. The grid is represented as a 9x9 matrix where empty cells are denoted by zeros.
2. **Backtracking Algorithm**: Tries to fill each empty cell with a valid number from 1 to 9, ensuring no conflicts with existing numbers in the same row, column, or 3x3 sub-grid.
3. **Constraint Checking**: Validates each move against Sudoku rules. If a move leads to a conflict, the algorithm backtracks and tries a different number.
4. **Solution Output**: Displays the solved Sudoku grid once a solution is found or notifies if no solution exists.

## Installation

1. **Clone the Repository**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/sudoku-solver.git
   ```
2. **Navigate to the Project Directory**
   ```bash
   cd sudoku-solver
   ```
3. **Install Dependencies** (if applicable)
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

## Usage

1. **Run the Solver**
   ```bash
   python sudoku_solver.py
   ```
2. **Input Format**: Enter the Sudoku grid in a 9x9 matrix format. Empty cells should be represented as zeros.

3. **Example**
   ```python
   grid = [
       [5, 3, 0, 0, 7, 0, 0, 0, 0],
       [6, 0, 0, 1, 9, 5, 0, 0, 0],
       [0, 9, 8, 0, 0, 0, 0, 6, 0],
       [8, 0, 0, 0, 6, 0, 0, 0, 3],
       [4, 0, 0, 8, 0, 3, 0, 0, 1],
       [7, 0, 0, 0, 2, 0, 0, 0, 6],
       [0, 6, 0, 0, 0, 0, 2, 8, 0],
       [0, 0, 0, 4, 1, 9, 0, 0, 5],
       [0, 0, 0, 0, 8, 0, 0, 7, 9]
   ]
   solver.solve(grid)
   ```

## Examples

Provide a few examples of Sudoku puzzles and their solutions to illustrate how the solver works.

### Example 1

**Input**
```plaintext
5 3 0 0 7 0 0 0 0
6 0 0 1 9 5 0 0 0
0 9 8 0 0 0 0 6 0
8 0 0 0 6 0 0 0 3
4 0 0 8 0 3 0 0 1
7 0 0 0 2 0 0 0 6
0 6 0 0 0 0 2 8 0
0 0 0 4 1 9 0 0 5
0 0 0 0 8 0 0 7 9
```

**Output**
```plaintext
5 3 4 6 7 8 9 1 2
6 7 2 1 9 5 3 4 8
1 9 8 3 4 2 5 6 7
8 5 9 7 6 1 4 2 3
4 2 6 8 5 3 7 9 1
7 1 3 9 2 4 8 5 6
9 6 1 5 3 7 2 8 4
2 8 7 4 1 9 6 3 5
3 4 5 2 8 6 1 7 9
```
